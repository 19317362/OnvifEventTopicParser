## Explanation

## Compilation
The Utility and the library are both designed and have been tested to work on both 32 and 64 bit Microsoft Windows 10. To compile simply open the .sln in Visual Studio 2017 and batch build all the desired programs. There is no feature in the code that is Windows 10 or Visual Studio 2017 specific, it has just only been tested on those platforms, so if you are using an older version of either try anyway.

## Usage
`Utility.exe [camera username] [camera password] [camera ip address] [optional: file path to send data]`
